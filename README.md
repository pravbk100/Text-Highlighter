# Text Highlighter
after effects text highlighter

Select the text layer in which you want certain word or text to be highlighted.
Launch the script.
This script will prompt you to type "Input" and "Occurances".
Type your text in "Input" which you want to highlight.
You can leave "Occurances" blank if the text you want to highlight occurs only once.

EXAMPLE : Your text layer has sentance "This can be done now or this can be done later".
and you want to highlight word "be".
"be" occurs 2 times in the sentance.
So if you want 1st occurance to be highlighted, then type "be" in "Input" and leave "Occurances" blank.
If you want 2nd occurance to be highlighted, then type "be" in "Input" and type 2 in "Occurances".
then press DoIt.

The script will create 2 color controls. These color controls will control highlight color.

It will create 2 keyframes with an expression, for these colors to animate.

Color change animation will occur before the 1st keyframe & after the 2nd keyframe.
so there will be STAY time between these two keyframes.

 Duplicate these 2 keyframes n amount of times, to have color change animation repeatedly.
